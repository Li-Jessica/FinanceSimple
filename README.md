## About FinanceSimple
FinanceSimple is a project I've made for SheHacks+ 6 2022. It is a brief financial reference guide. Its purpose is to teach and reinforce the concept of financial literacy. This project was first prototyped using Figma and then implemented with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

## Challenges
Some challenges I have faced include:
* Time constraint 
* Working with new technologies  
The nature of a hackathon is very time-limited, but it provides a chance to try out new concepts. This year I decided to challenge myself by making a responsive and interactive webpage, as well as using Figma to create a prototype. I have incorporated the use of Flexbox and Javascript, however, I ran out of time to fully implement/optimize to my desired goals. For instance, I ran out of time to make my flashcard minigame of finance terms under the Practice page of my site. 

This was what I wanted to do:

## Accomplishments
I am very proud of the prototype I have designed in Figma. I have been very interested in front-end development and design for a while, and Shehacks 6 gave me the chance to finally try it out. Overall, I really like the design for my webpage and it definitely helped when I was beginning to implement my idea. 

## Next Steps for FinanceSimple
Overall FinanceSimple gave me a great opportunity to try out new front-end and web development and was a good experience. My next steps are to implement a fully functional flashcard game (by using Javascript), as well as improve the responsiveness of my webpage to dynamically fit various device screen sizes.
